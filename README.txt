As a next step after the installation you could investigate the tutorial project. 
It is located in code/applications folder in mbeddr.
Alternatively, a pacemaker example could be of your interest. See it in the code applications.
Start MPS and open a project of your interest. Build languages first, to see the models 
displayed correctly.
